I learned to program on Commodore 8-bit computers, starting with the VIC-20 and then graduating to a C-128
(I skipped the 64, but that's OK since the 128 had one inside. :))

I still mess around with this stuff, mostly in emulation, and anything I think might be of interest I'll
stick here.

| [evalhex\_vic](evalhex_vic) | a VIC-20 port of the routine from Programming the Commodore 64 that teaches BASIC to recognize hex numbers like $900F. Actually, it's a port of the improved version created by Robin of 8-bit Show and Tell and featured in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8GuyK-1DmQ).
